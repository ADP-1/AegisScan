## 3. Architecture & Functionality

### 3.1 CLI Design & User Experience

- **Command-Line Interface:**  
  AegisScan is entirely CLI-based, ensuring rapid execution and easy integration into scripting and automation workflows.
- **Input Parameters:**  
  - **Target URL:** Accepts a URL (`-u` or `--url`) to scan.
  - **Scan Depth:** Configurable depth (`--depth`) to control the extent of vulnerability analysis.
  - **Test Selection:** Flags to run specific tests, e.g., `--sqlmap` for SQLi, `--xss` for XSS, `--csrf` for CSRF, or `--all` for a full scan.
  - **Output Options:** Ability to specify output format (`--format` with JSON, TXT, or HTML) and destination file (`--output`).
- **Interactive Mode**: When launched without arguments, provides a menu-driven interface
- **Multi-Mode Support**: Combine argument-based and interactive usage patterns
  
### 3.2 Vulnerability Detection Modules

- **SQL Injection (SQLi) Module:**  
  Leverages the capabilities of **sqlmap** to detect and report SQLi vulnerabilities by analyzing the application's database query handling.
  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Module:**  
  Employs techniques (and integrates with tools such as **xsstrike**) to scan for and report potential XSS vulnerabilities arising from weak input validation.
  
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Module:**  
  Tests for the presence (or absence) of proper CSRF tokens and secure session handling mechanisms to ensure robust protection against CSRF attacks.

### 3.3 Reporting Engine

- **Real-Time Console Output:**  
  Provides immediate feedback on scan progress and vulnerability detection with clear, color-coded messages.
- **Structured Reports:**  
  Generates detailed reports in multiple formats (JSON, TXT, HTML) that include:
  - Identified vulnerabilities categorized by type and severity.
  - Remediation suggestions and potential risk ratings.
  - Execution metrics such as scan duration and resource utilization.

### 3.4 Automation & CI/CD Integration

- **Seamless CI/CD Integration:**  
  AegisScan is designed to be integrated within CI/CD pipelines, automatically executing security scans on code commits, pull requests, and deployments.
- **Automation Scripts:**  
  Custom scripts and configurations are provided for GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI/CD, enabling automated security checks and artifact generation.
- **Exit Codes & Reporting:**  
  Uses standardized exit codes to signal scan outcomes, ensuring that failed scans can trigger notifications or block deployments as necessary.

## 4. Deployment Considerations

### 4.1 Performance Optimization

- **Lightweight Architecture:**  
  Utilizes minimal dependencies to reduce resource overhead and ensure rapid scan execution.
- **Scalability:**  
  Modular design allows for the addition of new vulnerability detection modules without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Efficient Execution:**  
  Multi-threaded scanning and optimized parsing reduce false positives and enhance performance.

### 4.2 Security & Compliance

- **Data Protection:**  
  Ensures that any sensitive data handled during scans is securely processed and not stored beyond the scope of the scan.
- **Compliance:**  
  Adheres to best practices and industry standards for ethical security testing, including proper disclaimers and usage guidelines.
